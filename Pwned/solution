üß© Pwned Machine Walkthrough ‚Äì HackMyVM
Difficulty: Easy
Goal: Gain initial access via leaked FTP credentials, then escalate to root using Docker group abuse.
Target IP: 192.168.1.132
Test Date: 07/06/2025

üîç Initial Enumeration
Full TCP port scan:

nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn 192.168.1.132
Service and version detection on discovered ports:

nmap -sCV -p21,22,80 192.168.1.132
Discovered open ports:

21/tcp ‚Äì FTP

22/tcp ‚Äì OpenSSH

80/tcp ‚Äì HTTP

üåê Web Analysis
Directory brute-forcing with Gobuster:

gobuster dir -u http://192.168.1.132 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html,txt -t 100
A login page is found. Viewing the source code reveals hardcoded FTP credentials.

üîë Initial Access via FTP and SSH Key

Using the leaked credentials, connect to the FTP server. Two files are downloaded:

id_rsa (SSH private key)

note.txt (mentioning user "ariadna")

Set correct permissions:

chmod 600 id_rsa
Access the target system via SSH:

ssh -i id_rsa ariadna@192.168.1.132
Access granted as user ariadna. The user.txt flag is found and read.

‚ö° Privilege Escalation to Root

Check for sudo permissions:

sudo -l
User ariadna can execute a script as selena without a password. Modify the script to spawn a reverse shell, then escalate to user selena.

Check user groups:

id
User selena is part of the docker group. Launch a container with host filesystem mounted:

docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
Root shell is obtained inside the container. Access to both user.txt and root.txt is confirmed.

üéØ Conclusion

The Pwned machine is fully compromised due to multiple security flaws:

FTP credentials were hardcoded and visible in the website's source code.

SSH private key was publicly accessible via FTP.

A script was misconfigured to be executed via sudo without restrictions.

Membership in the docker group allowed privilege escalation to root.

By chaining these misconfigurations, full system compromise was achieved, from unauthenticated web access to full root control.
