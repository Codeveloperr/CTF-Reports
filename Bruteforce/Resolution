üìë Finding Report: User Access and Privilege Escalation
Machine: Bruteforce ‚Äì HackMyVM

üü¢ Executive Summary
Severity: High
Description:
Initial access was obtained via brute-force attack against an SMB share user. The valid credentials were discovered using Hydra and the rockyou.txt wordlist. Post-authentication, access was granted as a limited user. Privilege escalation was achieved by running suBF.sh, which brute-forced the root password, ultimately allowing full system compromise and access to the root flag.

üñ•Ô∏è Scope and Environment
Platform: HackMyVM
Machine: Bruteforce (Linux ‚Äì Easy)
Assigned IP: 192.168.1.155
Date of Analysis: 25/05/2025

üõ† Tools Used

nmap

smbclient

hydra

rockyou.txt

suBF.sh (https://github.com/carlospolop/su-bruteforce)


üîç Finding Description

4.1 Port Scanning

nmap -sS -sV -oN bruteforce_nmap.txt 192.168.1.155
Port 445/tcp was found open, indicating an SMB service.

4.2 SMB Access and Information Gathering

smbclient -L \\192.168.1.155
smbclient \\\\192.168.1.155\\[SHARE] -U andrea
A readable readme file was identified and downloaded to the attacker's machine for local analysis.

4.3 SMB Brute Force with Hydra

hydra -l andrea -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt smb://192.168.1.XXX
Credential discovered:
Username: andrea
Password: awesome

4.4 Privilege Escalation with suBF.sh
Once logged in as andrea, the following brute-force script was executed locally to find the root password:

/tmp$ ./suBF.sh -u root -t 0.7 -s 0.05
Password discovered: 1998
Privilege escalation successful using su, and the root flag was retrieved.

üîê Impact
Critical. This vulnerability enabled:

Unauthorized access via SMB brute-force

Exposure of valid user credentials

Privilege escalation through offline root password brute-force

Full root-level system compromise

üõ° Recommendations

Disable SMB services if not required, or restrict them with proper authentication policies.

Enforce strong password policies to prevent brute-force attacks.

Monitor authentication logs and rate-limit login attempts.

Remove sensitive or unnecessary files from shared locations.

Prevent execution of brute-force tools by hardening system permissions.

Regularly audit local users and their password strength.
